# Cache Module Strategic Refactoring: Thread-Safe & High-Performance

## Overview

- **Goal**: Aggressively refactor cache module to thread-safe, high-performance with clean generic interfaces.
- **Core principle**: **All thread-safety is the responsibility of the cache layer**.
- **Design philosophy**: Bold interface redesign while preserving valuable enterprise features.
- **Approach**: Strategic refactoring - no fear of breaking changes, but build on proven foundation.
- **Providers**: Completely rewritten in-memory & Redis providers with optimal concurrency.

---

## Design Principles: Aggressive Refactoring Architecture

### Core Architectural Decisions

1. **Generic-First Design**: All cache interfaces are generic `Cache[T]` - no `interface{}` anywhere
2. **Provider-Managed Serialization**: Each provider handles serialization optimally for its backend
3. **Zero Consumer Locking**: Consumers never need mutexes, channels, or any synchronization primitives
4. **Type Safety by Default**: Compile-time type safety with zero runtime type assertions
5. **Performance Optimized**: Designed for high-throughput, low-latency concurrent access

### Enterprise Features Preserved & Enhanced

- **Secondary Indexing System**: Enhanced with thread-safe operations and batch support
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Existing go-metrics/Prometheus integration with new concurrency metrics
- **Security Features**: Timing attack protection, secure cleanup, enhanced for concurrent access
- **Middleware System**: Preserved chainable middleware with new generic interface support
- **Configuration System**: Rich functional options pattern maintained and extended

### Breaking Changes Made Boldly

- **No backward compatibility** - clean generic interfaces take priority
- **No `interface{}` types** - everything is strongly typed with generics  
- **No TypedCache wrapper** - the cache itself is generic
- **Provider interfaces completely rewritten** - optimized for each backend
- **Thread-safety moved to cache layer** - consumers simplified dramatically

## Phase 0: Core Interface Design

### Goal
Design clean, generic-first interfaces that eliminate all legacy complexity and provide optimal performance and type safety.

### New Interface Architecture

```go
// Primary cache interface - fully generic with enterprise features
type Cache[T any] interface {
    // Basic operations - thread-safe and generic
    Get(ctx context.Context, key string) (T, bool, error)
    Set(ctx context.Context, key string, value T, ttl time.Duration) error
    Delete(ctx context.Context, key string) error
    Clear(ctx context.Context) error
    Has(ctx context.Context, key string) bool
    
    // Atomic operations for concurrency (replaces consumer-side locking)
    GetOrSet(ctx context.Context, key string, loader func(ctx context.Context) (T, error), ttl time.Duration) (T, error)
    Update(ctx context.Context, key string, updater func(old T, exists bool) (T, error), ttl time.Duration) (T, error)
    
    // Batch operations for performance
    GetMany(ctx context.Context, keys []string) (map[string]T, error)
    SetMany(ctx context.Context, items map[string]T, ttl time.Duration) error
    DeleteMany(ctx context.Context, keys []string) error
    
    // Conditional operations
    SetIfNotExists(ctx context.Context, key string, value T, ttl time.Duration) (bool, error)
    SetIfExists(ctx context.Context, key string, value T, ttl time.Duration) (bool, error)
    
    // Secondary indexing (thread-safe)
    AddIndex(ctx context.Context, indexName string, keyPattern string, indexKey string) error
    RemoveIndex(ctx context.Context, indexName string, keyPattern string, indexKey string) error
    GetByIndex(ctx context.Context, indexName string, indexKey string) ([]string, error)
    DeleteByIndex(ctx context.Context, indexName string, indexKey string) error
    
    // Pattern operations
    GetKeysByPattern(ctx context.Context, pattern string) ([]string, error)
    DeleteByPattern(ctx context.Context, pattern string) (int, error)
    
    // Metadata operations
    GetMetadata(ctx context.Context, key string) (*CacheEntryMetadata, error)
    
    // Lifecycle
    Close() error
}

// Cache manager for creating provider-specific caches
type Manager interface {
    NewCache[T any](name string, opts ...Option) (Cache[T], error)
    RegisterProvider(name string, provider CacheProvider)
    Close() error
}
```

## Phase 5: Consumer Migration & Optimization

### Strategic Consumer Refactoring

**Aggressive simplification of go-auth sessionstore:**
- **Replace all mutexes and complex locking** with new atomic cache operations
- **Eliminate TypedCache wrapper layer** - use direct generic cache
- **Simplify session management** using GetOrSet, Update primitives
- **Preserve all existing functionality** while dramatically reducing complexity

**Leverage new cache capabilities:**
- **Atomic session creation**: `GetOrSet` replaces complex create-with-duplicate-check patterns
- **Atomic session updates**: `Update` replaces error-prone get-modify-set patterns
- **Thread-safe indexing**: Use new atomic index operations for subject->sessions mapping
- **Native type safety**: `Cache[*models.Session]` eliminates all type assertions and wrappers

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 5a: Refactor session manager with breaking changes**
```go
// Dramatically simplified session manager - no fear of breaking changes
type SessionManager struct {
    sessions     Cache[*models.Session]  // Direct generic cache - no wrappers  
    subjectIndex Cache[[]string]         // Thread-safe subject indexing
    // Zero mutexes, zero channels, zero synchronization primitives
}
```

**Phase 5b: Consumer API optimization**
- **Make breaking changes boldly** - prioritize clean design over compatibility
- **Eliminate all error-prone patterns** (manual locking, type assertions, race conditions)
- **Leverage cache-layer thread safety** - consumers become dramatically simpler
- **Reduce code complexity by 50%+** through atomic operations

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Performance improved by 5-10x for concurrent session operations
- [ ] Integration tests pass with both providers showing identical behavior
- [ ] Consumer API is dramatically simpler, safer, and more maintainable
